# Financial-Fraud-Detection
The financial fraud detection project, titled "Fraud Detection in Banking and Finance: Financial Fraud Detection Using Unsupervised Anomaly Detection", focuses on building a robust machine learning system to identify fraudulent transactions in real-time. The system leverages unsupervised learning techniques to detect anomalies within transaction data without relying on labeled examples.

Key aspects of the project include:

Dataset: The project utilized a dataset from Kaggle, containing diverse financial transaction records. Rigorous preprocessing was carried out to handle missing data, normalize values, and extract meaningful features.

Algorithm: The Isolation Forest algorithm was implemented as the primary anomaly detection method. This approach is highly effective in identifying data points that deviate significantly from the normal transaction patterns.

Feature Engineering: Transaction attributes, such as amount, timestamp, and location, were analyzed and transformed into actionable features to enhance the model's accuracy.

Evaluation: The model was evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliable performance. Results demonstrated significant accuracy in detecting fraud while minimizing false positives.

Focus on Adaptability: The system was designed to adapt dynamically to emerging fraud patterns by continuously learning from new transaction data.

Future Prospects: Plans include integrating clustering methods like DBSCAN and enhancing feature engineering to improve fraud detection capabilities further.

This project successfully highlights the potential of unsupervised anomaly detection in financial systems and demonstrates the applicability of machine learning in combating fraudulent activities
